## Welcome to VULab: Visual Understanding Lab at CWRU! 👋 
Our research lab is dedicated to advancing visual understanding through cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques. Our mission is to explore and develop innovative solutions in visual language models (VLMs), 3D vision, and more, to push the boundaries of how machines perceive and interpret the world.
